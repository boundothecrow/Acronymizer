# ⚠️ OLD PROJECT ⚠️
Instead of hiding my shame and deleting the repo I am going to keep it available. I created this back in 2017 when I realized that I need to showcase my skills and I had some free time to do so. This was part of my learning experience on how things like Git and GitHub works, as well as slowly understanding JavaScript more as I originally came from learning C#, Java, and Python. I would hide the overenthusiastic and goofy descriptions I wrote in the README and in most of the code, but I don't want to tamper too much with it, and I don't want to embarass myself.

# Acronymizer
Input your own series of letters and/or words, and have it spit out an acronym, with colorful choice of vocabulary!


## What's this all about, eh?
Well, it was already stated!


## Wow, that's amazing!
...yup, it sure is...


## What's an "Acrobet?"  Some kind of acrobatic gambler?
Acrobet is a play on words of sorts of combining "Acronym" and "Alphabet."  All of this is placed within a JSON file, so that each letter can be catagorized, and contain various amounts of "exciting" words.

This also seperates "regular" words, and explicit, not so work-friendly words.

###### (Soon there might be catagories to list different types of words, on top of the explicit set of words.  Like verbs, gadgets, people's names. etc)


## I see...what kind of words is expected to be added into your "Acrobet?"
Just words that you can mix together to make some sense.  However, I aim to add any words that might make a possible combination of words together to make it funny, even if it's a little nonsensical.  Using "NPM" as an example, some results might come out something like "Nostril Picking Managers," or "Nottingham Pickle Monsters."


## Can I contribute?
Sure!  Just make a pull request and show me what you got.


## I notice there's something wrong, and/or I would like to suggest something about your code.  Can I...
Yes please.  Message me, report an issue, anything helps!  I'm still fairly new to the world of programming and web development (I'm coming from doing some amateur C# coding).  So please, feel free to teach me!
